            <h4>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                     in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must 
                     be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff,
                     and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and former league members.
